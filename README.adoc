== TL;DR

Download the https://github.com/pixelstuermer/pixieset-downloader/tags[latest release] and install https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-396[Python 3.9.6], then switch to the root directory and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
Find out the required arguments `base_url`, `collection_id`, `collection_key`, `gallery_name` and obtain a valid HTTP session `cookie`.
The optional arguments `--filename`, `--separator` and `--regex` can specify the images to download and the target file names.

Then run the following:

----
python pixieset-downloader.py [-f FILENAME] [-s SEPARATOR] [-r REGEX] base_url collection_id collection_key gallery_name cookie
----

Or run the following for CLI usage help:

----
python pixieset-downloader.py -h
----

== About

Python script to download all found images of a Pixieset collection.
The mandatory arguments for the Pixieset API requests must unfortunately be found out via the browser developer tools when a collection website is accessed.
The script can filter the images to be downloaded via an user-given RegEx and it stores the images according to an user-defined naming scheme.

== Requirements

Built with/for https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-396[Python 3.9.6].
The required packages can be easily installed by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` before executing the script.

== How To Use

Tbd.

== Required Arguments

Tbd.

== Example

The following example accesses the publicly available https://josevilla.pixieset.com/lilyandjonathan[example collection] of Pixieset named `lilyandjonathan`.
The ID `3301757` can be found out when browsing the example collection and using the browser's developer tools.
The same applies to the given HTTP session cookie, which is not revealed in the example below.
It downloads all images of the `highlights` gallery having `xxlarge` in their name.
It then saves them with the naming scheme `example` and uses `-` as the counter separator.

----
python pixieset-downloader.py https://josevilla.pixieset.com/client/loadphotos 3301757 lilyandjonathan highlights {cookie} -r ".*xxlarge.*" -f "example" -s "-"
----

== Limitations

The downloaded images might still be watermarked and are maybe with lower quality than the originals â€“ which is good to support your local photographers!
It is also not guaranteed that absolutely all images have been downloaded, so this should be verified manually.
